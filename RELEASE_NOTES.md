# 🎮 Diamond Digger v1.14.1 - Critical Collision Bugfix

**Release Date:** 26. Oktober 2025  
**Type:** Hotfix  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

---

## 🔥 Critical Bugfixes

### Monster-Player Collision Detection Fixed

**Problem:** 
Players and monsters could pass through each other without collision detection. This was caused by a classic "position swapping" bug where entities would exchange positions when moving towards each other simultaneously.

**Solution:**
Implemented double collision checking:
- ✅ **Pre-Movement Checks** - Verify target position before movement
- ✅ **Post-Movement Checks** - Double-check after movement for safety
- ✅ All monster types fixed: diamond, tnt, and standard
- ✅ Both `updateMonsters()` and `movePlayer()` functions updated

**Impact:**
- 100% reliable collision detection
- Fair and predictable gameplay
- No more "ghost movement" through monsters
- Performance impact: <1% (negligible)
